# Home Work B7 24

Test driven dev :)

## Changes in v2:
 - JUnit Vintage has been replaced by the modern JUnit Jupiter API.
 - Added implementation of a simple binary tree and a simple implementation of the BFS algorithm for finding the shortest path.
 - A simple demonstration of the Java object model in calls of new BFS-classes.
 - All methods in classes now have the required access modifiers. To call these methods in the test class, the Java Reflection API is used.
